### Openframe-NodeClient
A simple Openframe client prototype written in Node.

This minimal client sets up a websocket connection with a specified username and displays a browser window into which images can be pushed. The idea is that this runs on a dedicated Raspberry Pi, and displays the images full screen using chromium in kiosk mode.

### Setup

See the [wiki](https://github.com/OpenframeProject/Openframe-NodeClient/wiki/Setup-Instructions) for Setup instructions.
